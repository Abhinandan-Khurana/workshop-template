## Workshop Template

Welcome to the Next Generation Team's design template for [building workshops](presentation.pptx), a system designed to help Microsoft Student Ambassadors and their partners to create and deliver excellent technical workshops.

## Types of Workshops

In this template you will find three types of workshops that you can build:

* **[Learn Workshops](./learn-workshop/README.md)** - a workshop that is designed to be completed within 30-90 minutes with content derived from [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com).
* **[Short Workshops](./short-workshop/README.md)** - a workshop that is designed to be completed within 15-30 minutes with content derived from [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com).
* **[Bespoke Workshops](./workshop/README.md)** - hand-designed workshops designed to be completed within 30-90 minutes.
 

## Building a Workshop

- [ ] Decide what kind of workshop you want to design and design your workshop following these steps.
- [ ] Fork this template repo to your local machine.
- [ ] Navigate to the folder of your chosen type of workshop and fill out the workshop-designer document to design the experience.
- [ ] Build slides for the workshop using the appropriate template, depending on which type of workshop you are building. 
    - For Learn-workshops, use our Particle tool to generate slides. Contact Chris or Jen for help.
    - Short-form workshops slides are optional.
- [ ] Write instructions for your workshop based on the README.md file in your folder's template. 
    - For Learn-workshops, your README.md work is minimal, and mostly links back to the source Learn module.
    - For Short-workshops, your README.md work is minimal, and mostly links back to parts of a Learn module.
- [ ] PR your workshop folder to the Next Generation Team's workshop library using [the library's PR template](https://github.com/microsoft/workshop-library)
- [ ] Trainers: Contact Chris or Jen to present your workshop to Ambassadors to generate a Train the Trainer video for inclusion in the library.
- [ ] Ambassadors: present workshops to your communities sourced from [the workshop library](https://github.com/microsoft/workshop-library). You can edit and use a [copy of this poster](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEuDXXR9us/share/preview?token=Je0_213uqxmYaXnNYz1v-Q&role=EDITOR&utm_content=DAEuDXXR9us&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton) to publicize it.
