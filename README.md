## Workshop Template

Welcome to the Next Generation Team's design template for [building workshops](presentation.pptx), a system designed to help Microsoft Student Ambassadors and their partners to create and deliver excellent technical workshops.

## Get started building a workshop

Start your course design process by reviewing this cheat sheet:
- [Workshop Cheat Sheet](cheat-sheet.md)

Then, design your workshop following the Understanding By Design Framework:

- [Workshop Designer](./workshop/workshop-designer.md)

Finally, build the workshop itself:

- [Workshop Template](./workshop/README.md)

Last, send a PR of your workshop to our workshop library for review, reuse and inclusion in the library, using [this repo's PR template](https://github.com/microsoft/workshop-library).

## Get Started building a workshop from a existing Microsoft Learn Module 

All content workshop subject matter will be focused on reusing content from our Microsoft Learn catalog. The spirit is finding content that resonates well with our audience.

Step 1. Find the closest[Microsoft Learn module/s](http://docs.microsoft.com/learn) to your chosen problem scenario in our [Microsoft Learn catalog](http://docs.microsoft.com/learn) then adapt it for the workshop as needed. 
-	Primarily, select modules that are ready to go, without modifications.
-	Secondary: If there are changes required to our [Microsoft Learn modules](http://docs.microsoft.com/learn) to make them workshop ready, we make them, consult with your lead before starting any such work.
Step 2. Generate/Create workshop build-out (slides and README), record Train The Trainer (TTT) resources/materials and store in centralized storage.
Step3. Help communicate the existence of the workshop via the Ambassador program.
Step 4. Then as part of the workshop, we drive traffic to Learn in two ways:
-	Exercises are encouraged to be held on Microsoft Learn itself in cases where attendees can’t connect to Azure/ don’t want to spend credits, where there’s a Sandbox available.
-	Call To Actions (CTA) leading to the sourced modules and other relevant modules for further learning.
