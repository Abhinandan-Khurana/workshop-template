## Workshop Template

Welcome to the Next Generation Team's design template for [building workshops](presentation.pptx), a system designed to help Microsoft Student Ambassadors and their partners to create and deliver excellent technical workshops.

## Types of Workshops

In this template you will find three types of workshops that you can build:

* **[Learn Workshops](./learn-workshop/README.md)** - a workshop that is designed to be completed within 30-90 minutes with content derived from [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com).
* **[Short Workshops](./short-workshop/README.md)** - a workshop that is designed to be completed within 15-30 minutes with content derived from [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com).
* **[Bespoke Workshops](./workshop/README.md)** - hand-designed workshops designed to be completed within 30-90 minutes.
 

## Building a Workshop

- [ ] Decide what kind of workshop you want to design and design your workshop following these steps.
- [ ] Fork this template repo to your local machine.
- [ ] Navigate to the folder of your chosen type of workshop and fill out the workshop-designer document to design the experience.
- [ ] Build slides for the workshop using the appropriate template, depending on which type of workshop you are building. 
    - For Learn-workshops, use our Particle tool to generate slides. Contact Chris or Jen for help.
    - Short-form workshops slides are optional.
- [ ] Write instructions for your workshop based on the README.md file in your folder's template. 
    - For Learn-workshops, your README.md work is minimal, and mostly links back to the source Learn module.
    - For Short-workshops, your README.md work is minimal, and mostly links back to parts of a Learn module.
- [ ] PR your workshop folder to the Next Generation Team's workshop library using [the library's PR template](https://github.com/microsoft/workshop-library)
- [ ] Trainers: Contact Chris or Jen to present your workshop to Ambassadors to generate a Train the Trainer video for inclusion in the library.
- [ ] Ambassadors: present workshops to your communities sourced from [the workshop library](https://github.com/microsoft/workshop-library). You can edit and use a [copy of this poster](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEuDXXR9us/share/preview?token=Je0_213uqxmYaXnNYz1v-Q&role=EDITOR&utm_content=DAEuDXXR9us&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton) to publicize it.

## Get Started building a workshop from a existing Microsoft Learn Module 

All content workshop subject matter will be focused on reusing content from our Microsoft Learn catalog. The spirit is finding content that resonates well with our audience.

Step 1. Find the closest[Microsoft Learn module/s](http://docs.microsoft.com/learn) to your chosen problem scenario in our [Microsoft Learn catalog](http://docs.microsoft.com/learn) then adapt it for the workshop as needed. 
-	Primarily, select modules that are ready to go, without modifications.
-	Secondary: If there are changes required to our [Microsoft Learn modules](http://docs.microsoft.com/learn) to make them workshop ready, we make them, consult with your lead before starting any such work.
Step 2. Generate/Create workshop build-out (slides and README), record Train The Trainer (TTT) resources/materials and store in centralized storage.
Step3. Help communicate the existence of the workshop via the Ambassador program.
Step 4. Then as part of the workshop, we drive traffic to Learn in two ways:
-	Exercises are encouraged to be held on Microsoft Learn itself in cases where attendees can’t connect to Azure/ don’t want to spend credits, where there’s a Sandbox available.
-	Call To Actions (CTA) leading to the sourced modules and other relevant modules for further learning.
