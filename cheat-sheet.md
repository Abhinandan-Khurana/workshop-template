# Workshop Cheat Sheet

Here are the steps to take to create a workshop:

## Creation phase

1. Click the green 'Use this template' button to copy this repo to your own GitHub account.
1. Review the questions in the [workshop designer](../workshop/workshop-designer.md) file, documenting your plans for the workshop.
1. Build the workshop using the [lesson template](../workshop/README.md) files.
1. Build slides as a preliminary presentation to explain the desired outcomes of the workshop.
1. When you think the workshop is ready for inclusion into the library, please send a pull request back to this repo using the PR template. **Only include your workshop folder in this PR**. A reviewer will be assigned to the workshop and will work with you to perfect it.

## Logistics phase

1. Invite your students to the workshop held on Teams, optionally using text from your [workshop designer](../template/workshop-designer.md) file to explain expected student takeaways. You can use [this template](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEuDXXR9us/EdQZLkVpknPAzSRD4fSxyw/view?utm_content=DAEuDXXR9us&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton&mode=preview) to design a poster about your session. There are marketing materials available on the Student Ambassador Teams tenant as well that you can use for promotion.
1. Gather your group of mentors and assign them groups of students if you have a larger group of students to teach. Meet with the mentors prior to the workshop, and walk through the suggested [mentor training](https://github.com/FrontEndFoxes/art/blob/main/frontend-foxes-mentor-training.pdf)

## Delivery phase

1. Hold the workshop on Teams, **keeping count of attendees**.
1. Start with slides, giving a presentation to introduce yourself and explain what students will discover.
1. After the presentation, walk through the [workshop](../workshop/README.md) files, explaining the milestones.

## Feedback phase 

1. Ask students in the workshop to fill out [this survey](https://forms.office.com/r/MdhJWMZthR), linked at the bottom of the workshop page. 
1. Fill in a [survey to catalogue your own experiences](https://forms.office.com/r/thfwmD0USG) as a workshop instructor using this form. We are very interested to learn any feedback from the workshop, including your experience as a teacher, your mentors' experiences, and any suggestions from any participant on to improve the workshop.
1. Log your activity via the MLSA program tools.

Have fun and thank you!
